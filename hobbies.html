<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<p>I am obssessed with music and have a project under the moniker AEON VOID in which <br />
   i create electronic music that is linked to a narative and visuals. I spend most of my spare <br />
   time exploring audio/visual concepts using programs such as but limited to: <br />
   <ul>
    <li>Ableton</li>
    <li>TouchDesigner</li>
    <li>Blender 3D</li>
    <li>Resolume</li>
   </ul>
</p>

<p>If im not doing that, im either reading (love philosophy) or keeping up with the latest <br />
   memes between friends.in terms of outdoor activities, i enjoy walking the dog on the beach, <br />
   as well as the odd hike in the mountains as long as there is a water source of some kind.
